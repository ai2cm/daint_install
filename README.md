# Piz Daint Installations

This repo serves to version installations on /project/s1053/install, such as for example the NCEP libaries, ESMF, FMS, or GridTools.

Note that this repo should only contains scripts to *build* binaries but you should never commit or push actual
build artefacts to this repo. The main purpose of this repo is to make sure we have backed up and versioned
installations instructions for tools, libraries and dependencies we require on Piz Daint.
